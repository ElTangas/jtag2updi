# jtag2updi

This is a firmware, that when uploaded on an atmega328p, or a similar AVR MCU running @16Mhz, enables it to interface with avrdude using the jtagice Mk2 protocol via a serial link. In particular, you can use an Arduino to host this firmware.
It provides a bridge to program the new attiny817 family of MCUs, that use the UPDI interface:

avrdude -> HW Serial interface -> Programmer MCU (e.g. Mega328P) -> SW Serial on PD6 -> Target MCU (e.g. tiny817)

Currently, I have not tested this software with a level shifter, so the target MCU must run at the same voltage as the programmer.

If you use an Arduino as host for this program, be sure that, after burning the software, you disable its auto-reset feature, using one of the techniques described here:
https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DisablingAutoResetOnSerialConnection

Alternatively, you can use an Arduino without integrated USB/serial adapter, like the pro-mini; in that case, just disconecting the DTR wire will disable the auto-reset. Just remember the UPDI chip must be connected to the same supply voltage as the Arduino!

To build, run the make.bat file, after editing it with the path of AVR-GCC on your system and the correct target MCU. I provide a makefile suitable for a MS-Windows environment, but I'm sure Linux users can manage.

There are also pre-built files on the "build" directory. They were built using avr-gcc 8.0.1 compiled for MinGW by sprintersb:

# Using with avrdude

You will find a modified avrdude.conf file in the base folder. This is based on the current avrdude.conf file from:
http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/avrdude/trunk/avrdude/avrdude.conf.in?revision=1422

It has been modified to work with avrdude 6.3, by removing (actually, commenting out) some incompatible stuff, and adding the "jtag2updi" programmer type.

The definitions for UPDI chips were slightly modified so that avrdude thinks they use the PDI programming interface instead of UPDI (i.e., avrdude thinks they are some kind of XMegas).

This allows the jtagice mk2 protocol to be used for programming UPDI chips, since this protocol predates UPDI and is not formaly compatible with it. Originaly, I had planed to use the STK500v2 protocol, and emulate the ISP interface, and I actually wrote an ISP version of the programmer software.

However, this would require entirely new definitions for the UPDI chips inside the avrdude.conf file, while using jtagice2 requires only very slight changes to the definions provided by Atmel (now Microchip).

Jtagice mk2 is the most advanced of Atmel's programming protocols that still supports a UART serial connection instead of USB, making it easily compatible with any Arduino you choose to host this software, and any OS you run avrdude on.

It's major limitation is speed; it can't go over 115200 Baud, because the protocol lacks definitions for higher speeds. It's actually inferior to the STK500v2 protocol in this respect, this older standard can run at any speed avrdude instructs it to.

Fortunatelly, the current UPDI chips do not have very large flash memories, so I think this isn't a major issue.
